<h1>spicebutton.com</h1>
<p>This repo was created for the first ever SLP virtual hackathon. 
Here you will find the full stack of spicebutton.com - from the front end of the website to the backend we jimmy-rigged together. 
The goal of spicebutton.com is to allow users of BCH to create a button to accept SPICE on any website. 
Special thanks to badger wallet, bitcoin.com, Soupernerd, and the DuneSquad team</p>
